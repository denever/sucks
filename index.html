--------

In the beginning, when The Internet was a place to spread *ideas*, *knowledge* and *breakthrough technology*, some people invented a simple and meaningful markup language in order to create Hypertextual documents: <acronym title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</acronym>

The purpose of this language was clear: to wrap a plain text document and evolve it into a more meaningful document, enriching it with interactivity, and multimedial content: a *HyperText*

    &lt;HTML&gt;
        &lt;HEAD&gt;
            &lt;TITLE&gt;Hello World!&lt;/TITLE&gt;
        &lt;/HEAD&gt;
        &lt;BODY&gt;
            &lt;H1&gt;Hello 1992&lt;/H1&gt;
            &lt;P&gt;This is mostly all you need to know about HyperText,&lt;BR&gt;
               use it &lt;B&gt;wisely&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
        &lt;/BODY&gt;
    &lt;/HTML&gt;

    
Then, the web was born. And it was fun and sharing for everyone. Sometimes ugly, sometimes useful, but mostly meaningful
    
But at some point, Someone decided that this was not enough. Someone decided we need more interaction, and more beauty. So, they created two companion: <acronym title="Cascading Style Script">CSS</acronym> and JavaScript. And everyone was grateful and happy, because possibilities were **infinite**

    &lt;SCRIPT&gt;
        document.write(\'Hello World, again!\');
        document.write(\'Today is \' + new Date().toLocaleString() + \' and i feel wonderful\');
    &lt;/SCRIPT&gt;
    
    &lt;STYLE&gt;
        body {
            color: black;
            background: lightgrey;
            font-family: Hevetica, sans-serif;
        }
    &lt;/STYLE&gt;
        
So, the web was now powerful, and beautiful, and somewhat complete. It had *style*, it was *interactive*, but most importantly, is purpose was clearly the same: **to provide meaningful documents**

Then again, at some point, someone decided it was not enough.

The web increased its dimension, it became so vast to be the first recognizable signal of Internet. It was so simple that everyone could learn it, and use it, and abuse it at his own risk. Because of this, someone decided it could be used to create websites to replicate functions used in other software. It was the born of **Web Applications**. Because of the easiness of HTML, lots of people claiming himself as *web developers* began to produce software based on the fashionable web technologies. Most of them had no apparent skills about real software production, but they were *trying*, because *web developement seems to be easy and fast*, and industries and software houses tended to enforce this idea, beacuse they smelled a new business opportunity.

Therefore, the so-called **Web 2.0** born, and shortly after, **Web 3.0**. HTML, CSS and JavaScript evolved acquiring more and more features, and now they can be used to create **real software applications** with all the complexity they needs. But, comparing it with traditional software developement, it lacks a **strong runtime support**, a **reliable compatibility** and a **widely accepted API**.

Plus, the main purpose is now lost. HTML does not provide text anymore. HTML provides applications. But HTML is not born to this purpose, so it does the job in a wrong way. And because of this, standard organizations try to fix it creating more and more standards. But reality is, they are spending money and time only to fix something that wasn't broken. And because of this, they broke it.
